A list of ideas from the conference

- Intro course idea: Collect data on what you eat and how much it costs to understand cost of living?  Or maybe calories/intake?
- Intro course idea: Have students measure their screen time and relate it to mental health (like 5 Q's survey or something?)

- ST 495 Idea: Have a class revolve around 307/308 research
  - Start with goals: What data should we collect
  - How do we summarize the data appropriately
  - How would tool A summarize the data appropriately?
  - Tool B? Use each and compare results
    - Have students then research another tool and try the method. Present it to the class.
    - Longitudinal data, lots of interesting things we could do
  - Keep circling back to goals
 
- Provide students with a resource on effective self study/reading
  - Not just highlighting, active note taking, rewrite note importance, summarize, put in big picture 
- Have activities in small grous that are 'active' readings through perusal
- 558/590 - Bring in industry people for live sessions/interviews
